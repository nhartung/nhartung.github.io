title: About Me

I am a professional software engineer that has been working on various embedded 
products in the aerospace industry for nearly a decade. As a developer, I pride 
myself on writing readable, self-documenting code. As a leader, I pride myself 
on building cohesive, psychologically safe teams that deliver quality products 
while providing transparent schedules. I'm extremely interested in automation 
and continuous integration, and strive for both no matter the environment I 
work in.

Outside of work I tend to work on programming projects unrelated to the 
embedded industry. I'm constantly challenging myself to learn new technologies 
and take on new projects. 
Take a look at my [Programming Blogs](../programming_blogs) 
to check out what I've been working on lately.

Believe it or not, I do more than program. I'm a huge basketball fan and am a 
season ticket holder for the Milwaukee Bucks. I enjoy reading to de-stress 
after a long day (check out what I'm reading on 
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79938869-nick-hartung)).

Most importantly, I have a son with my beautiful wife. While haning out with 
them takes away from the aforementioned hobbies, I wouldn't trade it for 
anything.
