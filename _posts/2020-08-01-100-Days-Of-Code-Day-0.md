# What is 100DaysOfCode?
It's simple. It's a personal challenge to code for a minimum of one hour every 
day for the next 100 days. In order to hold myself accountable, I will be 
tweeting out my progress every day, and, hopefully, occasionally blogging about 
my progress here.

If you are interested in learning more, check out the organizations 
[website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). Better yet, join me! Not a 
programmer? Not a problem! The 100 days movement started with programming, but
it has since evolved into [100DaysOfX](https://www.100daysofx.com/). X being, 
well, whatever you want! The website provides a list of challenges as options, 
but you can take on any personal challenge. It may sound daunting, but if you're
like me, you'll find no shortage of opportunities in your life where you can
spend time improving a skill rather than on something unproductive.
Self-improvement can be tough to stomach at first, but when it becomes a habit, 
it turns into a lifestyle.

# Why am I Doing This?
I love to program. It's my job, but it's also my passion. Unfortunately, I have 
commitment issues. My motivation to program ebbs and flows. Most recently
it hasn't been flowing at all. On top of that, I have a habit of starting more 
side projects than I can count. Nearly all of these go unfinished. I'm 
hoping to use this as an opportunity to start with a clean slate; a new project 
with a defined goal.

In addition to reevaluating the scope of my side-projects, I'm using this as an
opportunity to build a new daily habit. In the past I've read Charles Duhigg's 
[The Power Of Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit)
and James Clear's 
[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits).
Both of these books have been extremely influential to me, specifically 
Duhigg's. However, I've failed to consistently apply what I learned from those
books. It's about time I put what I've learned to practice.

# What is My 100DaysOfCode Goal?
My goal is to build a 2D game using [GoDot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Like 
most software engineers, I grew up with a passion for video games and always 
had a dream of making them for a living. Unfortunately, the realities
of that industry are not as glamorous as I had envisioned when I was younger 
and my dreams have evolved over time as I've moved on in my professional career. 
However, I've never forgotten my dream of making a game. In fact, I released a 
[game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_wp6GPjg60) on Android back in early 
2014 (It has since been removed from the store because I haven't maintained it).
It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was a game that I designed from the 
ground up. It wasn't running on any engine. I've come a **LONG** way as a 
developer since 2014, but since then I haven't made any significant progress 
towards releasing another game. I'd like to change that. Specifically I have 
the following [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and 
Stretch goals.

**SMART Goals**
1. After **30** days I will have a thorough understanding of the GoDot 
ecosystem and an initial design for a game laid out.
2. After **60** days I  will have a playable alpha-version of a game. It may not 
represent the final design, but I'd like to have something to send to people
to try out and get feedback on. This will ensure that I'm working towards
actually building a game and not continually building new features or learning
new concepts. I want to be sure that my work is productive.
3. After **100** days I will have the game design totally fleshed out. What may remain 
is adding additional content and building up a world from the already defined 
design. At this point, a path to finish should be in sight. Hopefully I'm 
regularly sending out updates to interested individuals for feedback.

**Stretch Goals**
1. After **100** days have a game released.

Attaining the above is aggressive, but if I suddenly have an uptick in 
motivation and productivity it doesn't seem impossible.

# How can You Follow Me?
1. Follow my blog. I will blog whenever I feel I have significant updates to 
describe. I will additionally be blogging at the 30, 60, and 100 day increments 
to provide status on my goals.
2. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NickHartung). I will be providing 
daily updates.
3. Star my [Github repository](https://github.com/nhartung/100-days-of-code) 
where I will be leaving more detailed daily notes on my progress.


I hope to interact with you as I progress. Wish me luck!
