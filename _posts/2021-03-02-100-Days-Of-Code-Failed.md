# Failed
Apparently there's a Henry Ford quote for everything. Although the quote I chose
for the subtitle of this blog helps, I can't help but feel disappointed with 
myself. I set myself a goal to complete 100 days of code challenge while working 
on a Godot project and came up well short. I did actually make it to day 30, but 
never got around to blogging my progress. It's difficult to believe that it has
been over 6 months since I last blogged, I'm not sure where the time has gone.

## What Happened?
I'm not a fan of excuses, but I'd like to document why I wasn't able to keep up
with the challenge. It came down to a perfect storm of responsibilities and 
distractions. Work became incredibly busy for me (and still is). We won a new
contract for a program that may end up being the largest in my company's long 
history and I'm leading one of the software teams. To make matters worse the
company we are working with is located in Germany which led to several weeks 
worth of 3am meetings to define the initial architecture for the system that we
are building. Parallel to that I started working on a separate side project with
a friend of mine that was consuming any of the spare time I had outside of work.
I kept telling myself that I'd get back to the 100 days of code challenge as 
soon as things normalized (they really haven't yet), but by the time I had 
opportunities to start working on it again I had already lost the habit and was
seriously lacking motivation.

## The Future
I wouldn't be doing the Henry Ford quote justice if I didn't plan to keep going.
I plan on continuing to learn Godot with the end goal of creating a game. 
However, I'm going to start fresh and consider my previous work in Godot as a
practice project. The be clear, I'm not starting another round of 100 days of 
code. I've decided that my life isn't in a position where I can reasonably 
dedicate an hour every day towards my goal. Having the goal looming over my day
also added a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety that I'm looking to avoid. 
I'm hopeful that I can still stick to something consistent, even if it's not per
the 100 days of code guide. I want to code because it's an activity that I enjoy
doing, not because it's one that I'm forcing myself to do. 

In addition to continuing to learn Godot, I'd like to make a habit out of
blogging. At the start of the year I have myself the goal of writing at least 1 
blog every month. It's already mid-March, and I'm just now releasing my first...
I guess I have some catching up to do. The topics of my blogs with vary. Some 
will focus on whatever project I'm working on at the time, others may be related
to whatever topics I find interesting. I've had a "blog ideas" Google Doc that's
been growing for years. It's time I start working those topics.
